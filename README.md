# Miguel Delgado â€“ Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio, built with React and based on an open-source template.  
It showcases my background, skills, certifications, and projects.

## About

This website was customized to reflect my journey as a software development student at FATEC Sorocaba, with focus on:

- Full Stack Development (Node.js, React, .NET, SQL)
- Clean, responsive design
- Clear presentation of certifications and project experience

## Credits

Originally based on the [developerFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) open-source template.
